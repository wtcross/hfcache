"""The per-repository ingestion sequence of plan §13.2.

This module holds the steps between "the bytes are in the cache" and "the
revision is published": proving what landed is what was promised, hashing it,
and describing it. The Hub is reached only through `hfcache.hub`, and the
archive only through `hfcache.publication` and `hfcache.storage`, so the
sequence itself stays testable without either.

The rule that shapes the whole module: **upstream metadata is a claim, and local
bytes are the evidence.** The Hub's tree listing says what a revision should
contain and how large each file should be, and that is what makes it useful for
deciding whether a download is complete. It never becomes what the archive
records as true — a manifest's sizes and digests come from reading the bytes
that actually landed (`AD-18`). The two are compared here precisely so that a
disagreement stops the revision rather than being published as fact.

    through a symlink, so a link is an entry in the snapshot whatever it points

    absent and a link to a directory as a container, and in both cases the entry

    """Prove the downloaded snapshot is exactly the revision (plan §13.2 steps 6-8).

    Four questions, three codes, and every one of them answered for the whole
    snapshot before returning — an operator fixing an incomplete download should
    see every missing file at once, not the first one.

    * **Is anything missing or extra?** `HFSYN002`. Missing means the download
      did not deliver what the Hub listed. Extra is reported just as firmly:
      the archive publishes the exact path set upstream declared, and a file
      nobody listed is either a stale artifact of an earlier revision or
      something this application does not understand. Publishing it would put
      content in an immutable revision that its own manifest cannot explain.

    * **Does every size agree?** `HFSYN003`. The Hub's size is a claim, so a
      mismatch does not say which side is wrong — it says they disagree, which
      is enough to stop a publication. `HUB-007` hashes the bytes afterwards and
      the manifest records what was read (`AD-18`); this check exists so a
      truncated file is caught before anything expensive happens to it.

    * **Is every source safe to publish from?** `HFSYN004`, delegated to
      `source_problems`, which is the same proof publication itself performs
      (`FS-15`). Running it here means a snapshot containing a symlink out of
      the cache root fails the completeness step rather than surviving to the
      staging loop.

    * **Would two paths collide on disk?** `HFSYN002`. A case or
      Unicode-normalization collision publishes a tree in which two manifest
      entries resolve to one file, which is silent corruption of the thing being
      archived (`docs/security.md` T-02, decision 15).

    The path *grammar* is checked here too, so a name that could escape is
    refused before it is joined onto anything.
